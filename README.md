1. Purpose of the Model
The purpose of this codespace is to develop a Churn Model for a telco. 

2. Dataset Used - Folder: 1. Dataset
The dataset used for this model/study is "telco_churn_data.csv" which was acquired from Kaggle under the name "JB Link Telco Customer Churn". The dataset is loaded into the repository in folder "1. Dataset".

3. Initial Data Analysis - Folder: 2. Initial Data Analysis
A highlevel analysis of the dataset was conducted to understand how to handle the data. This resulted in the identifcation of what data cleaning will be required in subsequent steps.

The high level analysis of the data set can be found in the repository folder "2. Initial Data Analysis".

4. Data Cleaning and Model Builing - Folder: 3. Data Cleaning + Building Model Elements
A statistical analyis has been carried out therfore a linear regression model was built. The intention was to predict the "Churn Value" for the dataset to identify which customer will churn.

The file Data_Cleaning + Model Elements.py contains all the code related to data cleaninging, preprocessing, model training, hyper parameter tuning and model evaluation.

5. Model Deployment - Folder: 4. Build and Tune ML Model
This folder contains all code to deploy the model into Azure ML.
